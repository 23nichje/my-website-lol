    <h1>Shiny Hunting Is Easy!</h1>
    <p>First, we need to learn some basics.</p>

    <h2>What is a shiny?</h2>
    <p>A Shiny Pokeon is a pokemon that is a different color than normal, here is an example.</p>
<a href='https://www.serebii.net/swordshield/pokemon/263-g.png'>Galarian Zigzagoon</a>
<a href='https://www.serebii.net/Shiny/SWSH/263-g.png'>Shiny Galarian Zigzagoon</a>
<p>So the normal chance of getting a shiny by just running into the pokemon is 1 in 4096 </p>
<p>There is an item you can obtain from the doctor in the Chirchester hotel room called the Shiny Charm,the only way to obtain this item is to complete your pokedex, that means you have to catch every pokemon

<p>these are all of the shiny rates using the Encounter Method</p>

<h1>The Masuda Method</h1>
